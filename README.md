Project Title: Medical Center Portal Management System using PHP/MySQLi

About
Medical Center Portal Management System is developed using PHP, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Talking about the project, it has all the essential features required for the user to view the hospital or pharmacy location and the price of a particular medicine or medical product by searching a medicine or medical product name. This system allows customers/clients to submit an appointment request with the pharmacy or hospital. The system also provides an online ordering system for the customer. The system has a Medicine checker that can help the customer check if the medicinal product or device is available and with this feature, the system will search not only in a single pharmacy because since the hospital or pharmacy are dynamically stored in the system database, the system will check the product in each hospital or pharmacy then returns the location and contact details of the pharmacy or hospital.
